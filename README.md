# ‚ú® QuantaVis ‚ú®

An immersive and interactive particle simulation inspired by the quantum world, brought to life through a unique collaboration between a developer and an AI. Move your mouse to influence thousands of particles and witness beautiful, emergent behavior.

## üöÄ About The Project

QuantaVis is a web-based experiment that visualizes a complex particle system in real-time. It's more than just a tech demo; it's a piece of interactive art. The simulation features:

*   **Thousands of Particles:** A lightweight `three.js` implementation ensures a smooth experience.
*   **Interactive Repulsion:** The particle cloud reacts to your cursor, creating a satisfying sense of control.
*   **Dynamic Lighting & Trails:** Elegant light streaks and color-shifting particles provide stunning visual feedback.
*   **Productivity Tools:** Includes an integrated Pomodoro timer and a background music player to help you focus.

This entire project was built conversationally, demonstrating a new paradigm of software development we call **"Vibe Coding"**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project leverages a modern, powerful tech stack:

*   **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - React Framework for the Web
*   **[React](https://react.dev/)** - The library for web and native user interfaces
*   **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** - For 3D graphics and the particle simulation
*   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - For utility-first styling
*   **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** - Beautifully designed, reusable components
*   **[Firebase Studio](https://firebase.google.com/studio)** - The AI-powered development environment

## ü§ù The Collaboration

This project was uniquely crafted by **[vertigotalks7](https://github.com/vertigotalks7)** and an AI assistant from **[Firebase Studio](https://firebase.google.com/studio)**.

The entire application was developed through a series of natural language prompts and refinements. This "vibe coding" process involved iteratively describing features, debugging issues, and polishing the user experience, all within a conversational interface.

**Final Score:**
*   **Prompts:** 25
*   **Debugs:** 12

This README, and the project it describes, stands as a testament to this new and exciting way of building software.
