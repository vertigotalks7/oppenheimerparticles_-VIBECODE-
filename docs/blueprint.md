# **App Name**: QuantaVis

## Core Features:

- Particle System: Generates a visual representation of interactive particles that react to mouse movement, simulating fluid dynamics or viscous motion.
- Light Streaks: Adds light streak effects when the user clicks and drags the mouse, creating dynamic visual trails.
- Interactive SFX: Plays subtle sound effects upon user interaction (mouse clicks, drags) to enhance the immersive experience.
- Glass UI: Implements a blurred, translucent, glass-like interface style reminiscent of iOS design to add minimal UI elements and a modern aesthetic.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) to evoke a sense of depth and the mysteries of quantum physics. The choice reflects the thematic depth suggested by Oppenheimer and quantum interactions.
- Background color: Very dark blue (#0A192F) provides a stark contrast to the brighter particles and light streaks.
- Accent color: Pale cyan (#7DD3FC) to highlight interactive elements and emphasize the technological aspect.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for clarity and a modern feel suitable for any UI elements present.
- Particles should have smooth, flowing movement, resembling a viscous fluid. Mouse interaction should cause a gentle, responsive displacement of particles.
- Minimalist design with the particle system taking center stage. Any UI elements (if present) should be translucent and non-obtrusive.
- Use simple, line-based icons, if any are needed, to maintain a clean and uncluttered interface. These should subtly react to the background particle interactions, mimicking the fluidity.
